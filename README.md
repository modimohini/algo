# algo 
n! n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)
4! 4x3x2x1
clearly defined problem statement input and output 
split the problen into smaller chuncks of problems with determining input and output

- Time efficiency, space efficiency (memory use/required)
- Runtime  [best case, average case, worst case]

* Big O
- Theoretical defination of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size
- O = order of magnitude of complexity
- O(n)

* Liner search (n * times)

* Binary search
- condition input list must be sorted 
- O(log n)

- Quadratic runtime o(n^2)

- Quasilinear O(n log n)

- Polynomial runime 

- Brute Fource
